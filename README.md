# Mental Health Tracker

Mental Health Tracker is a Python-based application developed using Tkinter.
The application is designed to help users track their mental health conditions
through user inputs, self-assessment tests, and simple interactive features.

## Project Background
This project was created during my **first semester** as part of a **Basic Programming** course.
The idea for this application came from a real and relevant problem I experienced at that time,
where mental health awareness among students became increasingly important.

The project was later revisited and refactored to improve UI scalability
and overall code structure.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Tkinter
- Pillow (PIL)
- Pygame
- CustomTkinter

## How to Run the Program

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system (Python 3.8 or later is recommended).

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Navigate to the project directory.

4. Run the main application file:
  python main.py

## Notes
This project represents my early learning phase in programming.
While it reflects my skill level at that time, it also serves as an important milestone
in my development journey as a software developer.
